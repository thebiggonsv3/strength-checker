Hello! This is a short project testing the strength of passwords out of a score of 5.
This code tests to see how proportional the password is. What that means is that it checks for how much lowercases, how much uppercases, numbers, and special characters there are in relation to each other. Bonus points for hitting a length of 6 and 15 respectively. 

Run the code like how a C program normally would.
